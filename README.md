# Unofficial DirectX 5 for Windows NT 4 (AXP)
This is DirectX 5.0 for Windows NT 4 on **DEC Alpha architecture computers**.

The goal is to run old DirectX-based software (i.e. games designed for Windows 95) in conjunction with the usual x86 translation layer.

## Prerequisites
- Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 or higher
- FX!32 or wx86

## Install
1. Move all the `dll`, `exe` and `cpl` files into your `%systemroot%\system32` directory
2. Hope that it works with your game â€“ it really depends

## Caution
This is _not_ for x86/i386 architecture computers. It will not work and break your system, look out for good old DX5NT4.ZIP instead.
